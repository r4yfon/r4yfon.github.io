FreshSavings is a community-driven pantry and recipe management web application. It helps users track their pantry items, share surplus food with the community, and generate recipes based on available ingredients. This project is a personal remake of a university assignment [https://github.com/r4yfon/FreshSavings](https://github.com/r4yfon/FreshSavings), for the purpose of learning and improving my skills in web development.

The initial version of this project was scaffolded using [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev), providing a solid foundation for rapid prototyping. Since then, the codebase has been extensively refactored and enhanced to improve maintainability, add new features, and experiment with modern web development practices.

## Features

- **Pantry Management:** Add, edit, and remove pantry items. Track expiry dates and categories.
- **Community Kitchen:** Share food items with the community and see what others have shared.
- **Recipe Generator:** Get recipe ideas based on your pantry contents.
- **Authentication:** Secure sign-in and sign-up.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Functions)
- **State/Data:** React Query
