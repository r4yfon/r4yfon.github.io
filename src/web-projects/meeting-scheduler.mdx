WFH Management Tool is a comprehensive solution designed to manage work-from-home (WFH) schedules for employees. The project features a backend built with Flask and a frontend developed using Vue 3 with Vite. It facilitates employee management, WFH request handling, schedule viewing, and status logging.

## Key Features

- **Employee Management:** Manage employee data including personal details and roles.
- **WFH Requests:** Employees can submit one-time or recurring WFH requests.
- **Schedule Management:** View and manage WFH schedules for employees.
- **Request Handling:** Approve, reject, or rescind WFH requests.
- **Status Logging:** Log and track the status changes of WFH requests.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.x
- MySQL

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Vercel, with both frontend and backend hosted on the platform. The database is managed using NeonDB, a serverless PostgreSQL provider.

- **Live Demo:** [https://is212-frontend.vercel.app/](https://is212-frontend.vercel.app/)

## Database

The project uses a MySQL database with multiple tables to store employee data, request data, and status logs. The schema supports a microservices architecture.

- `employee`: Stores employee data such as name, email, and phone number.
- `request`: Stores request data such as request ID, employee ID, request date, and request status.
- `request_dates`: Stores the dates for work-from-home requests, supporting one-time and recurring requests.
- `status_log`: Stores status log data such as request ID, employee ID, request date, and status change.

## Backend

The backend is composed of multiple Flask applications, each dedicated to a specific functionality:

- `employee.py`: Manages employee data.
- `request.py`: Handles WFH requests.
- `request_dates.py`: Manages dates for WFH requests.
- `view_schedule.py`: Provides schedule views for employees.
- `view_requests.py`: Allows employees to view their requests.
- `reject_requests.py`: Handles rejection of requests.
- `status_log.py`: Logs status changes of requests.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with Vue 3 and Vite, utilizing Vuetify and PrimeVue for UI components. It provides an intuitive interface for employees to manage their WFH schedules and for managers to oversee and approve requests.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/r4yfon/is212-wfh-management-tool.git
   ```

### Database Setup

2. **Run the SQL script in the `backend/SQL` directory to create the database and tables.**

### Backend Setup

3. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
