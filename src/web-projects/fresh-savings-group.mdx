Freshsavings is an all-in-one platform to reduce wastage of expired food in Singapore. Over the past 10 years, food waste has become one of the biggest waste streams and the amount generated has grown by 20%!

This project was originally developed as a university group project, and later remade as a personal project to further improve and modernise the application.

We aim to tackle the problem through a three-pronged approach:

- **Inventory Tracker:** Keeps track of inventory at home and reminds users of food products that are soon to expire.
- **Recipe Generator:** Recommends food recipes based on the user's list of items in Inventory Tracker.
- **Marketplace:** Sell or purchase food products that are soon to expire at highly discounted prices.

## Description

### Vue

We used `VUE3 cli` for this project, allowing us to customize configuration. [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

Most notable portions included the use of Vue Routers.
We created `components` that were reused in various places and imported them where needed to streamline the application. Such components include NavBar and Footer.

### Bootstrap & CSS

We made use of the `12-point grid system` to help make our application responsive. We utilized Bootstrap features like `modal`, `accordion panel`, and styled our website using CSS and icons. We took ideas for our marketplace design from existing HTML templates such as [this](https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-homepage).

## API Used

We incorporated [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) into the project.

## Beyond the Lab

### Github

We created a `repo` and used it for version control and collaboration.

### Pinia and localStorage

We used Vue's official state management library `Pinia` for global state management across our application. We also incorporated browser `localStorage` where appropriate, allowing us to persist information when routing through different views and through refresh.

### AWS RDS and MySQL

We used Amazon RDS as a managed relational database service for the MySQL server. It allowed us to operate and scale the database on the cloud.

### Animation Libraries

We used Lottiefiles to incorporate lightweight SVG animation files.
