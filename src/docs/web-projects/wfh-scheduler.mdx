WFH Scheduler is a comprehensive solution designed to manage work-from-home (WFH) schedules for employees. The project features a backend built with Flask and a frontend developed using Vue 3 with Vite. It facilitates employee management, WFH request handling, schedule viewing, and status logging.

Users can log in as regular staff, managers, or CEOs, each with different access rights and dashboard views. Staff can submit and view their own WFH requests. Managers can view and manage requests for employees in their team, approve or reject requests, and oversee team schedules. CEOs have access to organization-wide data and can monitor all teams and requests.

## Key Features

- **Employee Management:** Manage employee data including personal details and roles.
- **WFH Requests:** Employees can submit one-time or recurring WFH requests.
- **Schedule Management:** View and manage WFH schedules for employees.
- **Request Handling:** Approve, reject, or rescind WFH requests.
- **Status Logging:** Log and track the status changes of WFH requests.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Vercel, with both frontend and backend hosted on the platform. The database is managed using NeonDB, a serverless PostgreSQL provider.
